# webext-dynamic-content-scripts on Manifest v2

- Chrome MV2: no longer supported, use `webext-dynamic-content-scripts` v10
- Safari MV2: probably still works, but not tested
- Firefox MV2: probably still works, but not tested

_For Manifest v3, refer to the [Usage section on the main readme](readme.md)._
